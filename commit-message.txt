feat(docs): add comprehensive workflow documentation with registry flexibility and double-counting prevention

This commit introduces major documentation enhancements including development roadmap,
end-to-end workflows, registry change management, and strict double-counting prevention
policies.

**New Documentation:**

1. docs/development/README.md - Comprehensive 40-week development roadmap:
   - Development setup and prerequisites
   - 10-phase implementation plan (Weeks 1-40)
   - Step-by-step workflows for each phase
   - Best practices for code, database, events, and security
   - Testing strategy and code standards
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. docs/architecture/COMPREHENSIVE_WORKFLOWS.md - Complete platform workflows:
   - Complete 8-phase credit issuance workflow (4-8 weeks typical)
   - Detailed step-by-step breakdowns for each phase
   - Registry-first approach with gap analysis
   - 9-category verification process
   - Blockchain integration workflows (NEAR NFT minting)
   - Error handling and recovery scenarios with Saga pattern
   - Decision trees for registry selection and verification
   - Presentation outline for stakeholders

**NEW: Registry Change Management (Section 10):**
   - Stage-by-stage impact analysis for registry changes
   - Stage 1 (Before Computation): ✅ Low impact (< 1 day)
   - Stage 2 (After Computation): ⚠️ Medium impact (1-2 days)
   - Stage 3 (After Verification): ⚠️ High impact (2-4 weeks)
   - Stage 4 (After Hash): ❌ Very high impact (4-6 weeks, requires new submission)
   - Stage 5 (After Registry Submission): ❌ Blocked (cannot change existing)
   - Comprehensive registry change API with impact assessment
   - UI/UX mockups for registry change workflow
   - Multi-registry parallel strategy (with caveats)
   - Registry change events and audit trail
   - Decision matrix for change scenarios

**NEW: Double-Counting Prevention (Section 8 - Rewritten):**
   - ⚠️ Critical compliance rules: Multi-registry issuance = fraud
   - Clear definition of double-counting violations
   - Registry policies from Verra, Puro, Isometric, Gold Standard, EU ETS
   - ❌ PROHIBITED: Simultaneous multi-registry active credits
   - ✅ PERMITTED: Compare registries, then select ONE for issuance
   - ✅ PERMITTED: Sequential retirement (issue → retire → reissue elsewhere)
   - ✅ PERMITTED: Registry migration (void in A → reissue in B)
   - Platform policy: Strict single-registry enforcement
   - evidence_hash duplication detection system
   - Database schema with triggers to prevent double-counting
   - Enforcement logic and compliance workflows
   - Cross-tenant fraud detection

**Architecture Updates:**

- dmrv_saa_s_architecture_near_nft_design.md: Enhanced with:
  - Registry-first approach (registry selection before computation)
  - Gap analysis system for identifying missing registry requirements
  - Dual-hash model (mrv_hash + evidence_hash) for cross-registry deduplication
  - Updated credit lifecycle to reflect registry-driven workflow
  - New event: mrv.registry.selected.v1
  - Registry requirements catalog and gap check APIs

- docs/README.md: Updated to reference new development and architecture folders

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. Registry Flexibility:
   - Users can change target registry at any workflow stage
   - Clear impact assessment shown before confirmation
   - System automatically invalidates dependent work (computation, verification, hash)
   - Audit trail maintained for all registry changes
   - Support for exploratory gap analysis across multiple registries

2. Double-Counting Prevention:
   - evidence_hash tracks raw evidence globally across all registries
   - Automatic blocking when same evidence used for multiple active credits
   - Manual compliance review required for exceptions
   - Support for legitimate use cases (comparison, migration, retirement)
   - Database constraints enforce single-active-credit-per-evidence rule

3. Registry-First Workflow:
   - Registry selection happens BEFORE computation (Phase 0)
   - Computation is registry-specific (different methodologies per registry)
   - Gap analysis enables proactive data collection guidance
   - Evidence hash enables cross-registry deduplication while allowing
     registry-specific claim hashes

4. User Experience:
   - Compare multiple registries before committing (gap analysis for all)
   - Clear warnings about work loss when changing registries
   - Cost and timeline estimates for registry changes
   - Support for "what-if" scenarios without commitment

**Events Added:**
- project.registry.changed.v1: Registry change initiated
- computation.invalidated.v1: Computation invalidated due to registry change
- verification.invalidated.v1: Verification invalidated due to registry change
- submission.parallel.created.v1: Parallel registry submission created

**Database Changes (Documented):**
- hashing.evidence_registry: Global evidence tracking table
- Unique constraint on evidence_hash
- Trigger: enforce_single_active_credit (prevents double-counting)
- registry_submissions JSONB array tracking all registry submissions per evidence

**Compliance & Security:**
- Strict enforcement of single-registry issuance by default
- Cross-tenant fraud detection via evidence_hash
- Audit trail for all registry changes and evidence usage
- Manual approval required for multi-registry scenarios
- Alignment with Verra VCS Standard §3.14, Puro methodology, Isometric protocol

Breaking Changes: None (documentation only)

Impact: This documentation enables flexible registry selection while maintaining
strict compliance with double-counting prevention regulations.
