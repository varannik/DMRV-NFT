feat(docs): add comprehensive development guide and registry-first workflow documentation

This commit introduces major documentation enhancements to support the DMRV platform
development and architecture understanding.

**New Documentation:**
- docs/development/README.md: Comprehensive 40-week development roadmap with:
  - Development setup and prerequisites
  - 10-phase implementation plan (Weeks 1-40)
  - Step-by-step workflows for each phase
  - Best practices for code, database, events, and security
  - Testing strategy and code standards
  - Troubleshooting guide

- docs/architecture/COMPREHENSIVE_WORKFLOWS.md: End-to-end workflow documentation:
  - Complete 8-phase credit issuance workflow
  - Registry-first approach with gap analysis
  - 9-category verification process
  - Blockchain integration workflows
  - Error handling and recovery scenarios
  - Multi-registry scenarios
  - Decision trees and presentation outline

**Architecture Updates:**
- dmrv_saa_s_architecture_near_nft_design.md: Enhanced with:
  - Registry-first approach (registry selection before computation)
  - Gap analysis system for identifying missing registry requirements
  - Dual-hash model (mrv_hash + evidence_hash) for cross-registry deduplication
  - Updated credit lifecycle to reflect registry-driven workflow
  - New event: mrv.registry.selected.v1
  - Registry requirements catalog and gap check APIs

**Documentation Structure:**
- docs/README.md: Updated to reference new development and architecture folders

**Key Architectural Changes:**
- Registry selection now happens BEFORE computation (Phase 0)
- Computation is registry-specific (different methodologies per registry)
- Gap analysis enables proactive data collection guidance
- Evidence hash enables cross-registry deduplication while allowing
  registry-specific claim hashes

Breaking Changes: None (documentation only)
