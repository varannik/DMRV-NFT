feat(dashboard): comprehensive state management specification v4.1

This commit significantly expands the dashboard state management specification
from 25 to 44 categories, adding complete coverage for backend operations,
event-driven architecture, governance, and notification delivery tracking.

**State Management Updates (apps/dashboard/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md):**

Version 4.1 - Governance/Ops + Notification Delivery Tracking:
- Added 3 new state categories (#42-44):
  - Dispute / Appeal / Case Management State
  - SLO/SLA + Incident + Runbook + DR/Backup Operations State
  - Notification Delivery / Outbox / Provider Health State

Version 4.0 - Backend Operations & Event-Driven Architecture:
- Added 16 new state categories (#26-41):
  - Retirement Saga State (4-step workflow separate from credit issuance)
  - Event Replay & Recovery State (replay jobs, event store, snapshots)
  - Schema Registry State (versioning, compatibility, migrations)
  - Consumer Management State (health, lag alerts, backpressure)
  - API Idempotency State (cache, deduplication, replay detection)
  - Registry Adapter Health State (circuit breakers, retry queues, DLQ)
  - NEAR Indexer State (block sync, transaction monitoring)
  - Registry Requirements Catalog State (requirements per registry/methodology)
  - Methodology State (selection, formulas, result caching)
  - Retirement Certificate State (generation, IPFS storage, downloads)
  - Registry Cancellation State (requests, compensation tracking)
  - Circuit Breaker State (per-service state machine)
  - Dead Letter Queue State (messages, review workflow, resolution)
  - Event Store State (multi-tier storage: hot/warm/cold)
  - Snapshot/Checkpoint State (component snapshots, restore capability)
  - Process Timeout State (timeout config, ETA calculation, predictions)

**Key Improvements:**

Complete Architecture Coverage:
- Now covers 100% of backend operations from dmrv_saa_s_architecture_near_nft_design.md
- Sections 12-33 fully represented in state management
- Governance model (Section 21) with dispute resolution workflows
- SLO/SLA monitoring (Section 18.2) with incident management
- Notification delivery tracking (Section 27) with outbox pattern

State Categories Breakdown:
- Core Platform State: 17 categories (Phases 1-4: Weeks 1-8)
- Advanced Features: 8 categories (Phases 5-6: Weeks 9-12)
- Backend Operations: 16 categories (Phases 7-9: Weeks 13-18)
- Governance & Ops: 3 categories (Phase 10: Weeks 19-20)
- Total: 44 state categories + 14 advanced patterns

**New State Categories Details:**

#42 - Dispute / Appeal / Case Management State:
- Dispute case lifecycle (credit rejection, verification dispute, ownership, methodology)
- SLA tracking per dispute type (14-30 days)
- Escalation workflows (support → dispute committee → arbitration)
- Evidence attachments and case history
- Outcome tracking and resolution

#43 - SLO/SLA + Incident + Runbook + DR/Backup Operations State:
- Service Level Objectives monitoring (API availability, mint latency, registry sync)
- Incident management (P1-P4 tiers, response times, runbook execution)
- Disaster recovery readiness (RPO < 1 min, RTO < 15 min)
- Backup freshness tracking (database, event store, IPFS)
- Failover drill status and multi-region health

#44 - Notification Delivery / Outbox / Provider Health State:
- Unified outbox for email + webhook notifications
- Delivery attempt tracking with retry logic
- Provider health monitoring (email service, webhook endpoints)
- Suppression lists and bounce handling
- Delivery metrics (success rate, latency, failure reasons)

**Implementation Phases Updated:**

Phase 7: Backend Operations Monitoring (Weeks 13-14)
- Retirement Saga, Circuit Breakers, DLQ, Registry Adapters, NEAR Indexer

Phase 8: Event-Driven Architecture (Weeks 15-16)
- Event Replay, Schema Registry, Consumer Management, API Idempotency, Event Store

Phase 9: Advanced Operations (Weeks 17-18)
- Requirements Catalog, Methodology, Certificates, Cancellations, Snapshots, Timeouts

Phase 10: Governance & Reliability (Weeks 19-20) [NEW]
- Dispute Management, SLO/SLA Monitoring, Incident Management, Notification Delivery

**Documentation Updates:**

- Updated STATE_MANAGEMENT.md from v3.0 (25 categories) to v4.1 (44 categories)
- Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all 19 new state categories
- Updated implementation roadmap with new phases
- Added version history tracking (v4.0 and v4.1)
- Updated summary section with complete category breakdown

**Architecture Alignment:**

Based on comprehensive analysis of:
- docs/architecture/COMPREHENSIVE_WORKFLOWS.md
- dmrv_saa_s_architecture_near_nft_design.md (Sections 12-33, 18, 21, 27)

**Impact:**

- Enables full-stack dashboard: frontend user interactions + backend operations monitoring
- Provides complete state for admin/operator dashboards
- Supports governance workflows (disputes, SLAs, incidents)
- Enables notification delivery observability
- Ready for implementation of all 44 state categories across 10 phases (20 weeks)

Breaking Changes: None (documentation only)
