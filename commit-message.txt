feat(dashboard): add Carbon Credit Marketplace with DMRV/Marketplace mode switch

This commit adds a comprehensive Carbon Credit Marketplace dashboard built on
NEAR Protocol, with a new sidebar toggle to switch between DMRV and Marketplace
modes. Inspired by carbonplace.com's approach to carbon credit trading.

**Major Feature: DMRV/Marketplace Mode Switch**

Added toggle in the left sidebar to seamlessly switch between:
- **DMRV Mode**: Original dashboard with Projects, MRV, Verification, Credits
- **Marketplace Mode**: New carbon credit trading platform

The toggle persists user preference to localStorage and updates navigation
items, color schemes, and layout accordingly.

- Optimistic updates for buy/sell/retire actions

Filtering System:
```typescript
interface MarketplaceFilters {
  registries: MarketplaceRegistry[]
  methodologies: MethodologyCategory[]
  subtypes: MethodologySubtype[]
  priceRange: { min: number; max: number }
  vintageYears: { min: number; max: number }
  countries: string[]
  coBenefits: { biodiversity, sdgAligned, communityDevelopment, indigenousRights }
  verification: { recentlyAudited, thirdPartyVerified }
  sortBy: 'price_asc' | 'price_desc' | 'newest' | 'oldest' | 'popular' | 'volume'
  searchQuery: string
}
```

Wallet Integration (Mock):
```typescript
interface WalletState {
  isConnected: boolean
  accountId: string | null
  balance: { near: number; usd: number }
  network: 'mainnet' | 'testnet'
}
```
