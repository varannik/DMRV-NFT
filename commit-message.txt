**Dashboard Application (apps/dashboard/):**

Frontend Implementation:
- Next.js 16.1.1 with App Router and React 19
- TypeScript 5 with strict type checking
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- ESLint for code quality

Dashboard Features (Structure):
- Registry-first workflow with gap analysis UI
- 8-phase credit lifecycle visualization
- 9-category verification checklist interface
- Credit (NFT) management with NEAR blockchain integration
- Process tracking with progress indicators
- Registry change management with impact assessment
- Double-counting prevention UI with compliance indicators
- Multi-tenant support with tenant context switching

Documentation:
- apps/dashboard/README.md: Full dashboard documentation with features, API
  integration, authentication, multi-tenancy, and deployment instructions
- apps/dashboard/QUICK_START.md: Step-by-step getting started guide with
  installation instructions and next steps
- apps/dashboard/PROJECT_SETUP_SUMMARY.md: Complete setup summary with
  implementation roadmap and success metrics
- apps/README.md: Overview of all frontend applications

Integration Points:
- API Gateway connection via lib/api/
- Shared types from ../../shared/types/ or ../../types/
- Authentication from ../../shared/auth/
- NEAR smart contracts from ../../smart-contracts/nft-contract/

Technology Choices:
- Next.js App Router for modern React features and SSR
- Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first styling
- shadcn/ui components (to be installed)
- SWR or TanStack Query for data fetching (to be installed)
- React Hook Form + Zod for forms and validation (to be installed)

**Project Organization:**
- Created apps/ folder for frontend applications
- Separated dashboard from static UI mockups (UI/ folder)
- Updated root README.md to include apps/ and UI/ references
- Monorepo structure: apps/ (frontend) + services/ (backend)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd apps/dashboard
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

Breaking Changes: None (new application)

Impact: 
- Enables development of production-ready user interface
- Provides clear structure for implementing DMRV workflows
- Ready for immediate frontend development with complete documentation
- Based on comprehensive workflows from docs/architecture/COMPREHENSIVE_WORKFLOWS.md
