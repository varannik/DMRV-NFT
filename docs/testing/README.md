Testing strategy and environments.

Put here (aligned to the gaps analysis):
- Testing pyramid and per-service standards (unit/integration)
- Contract testing strategy for service boundaries and external registries
- E2E scenarios for issuance/retirement/reversal flows
- Load and soak testing plans (queue depth, throughput, latency targets)
- Chaos testing / failure injection plan (DLQ, registry outages, NEAR RPC outages)
- Test data management (seeding, anonymization, fixtures)
