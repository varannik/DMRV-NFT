Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Each ADR should capture:
- Context/problem
- Decision
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences/trade-offs
- Links to relevant issues/PRs

Suggested early ADRs:
- Multi-tenancy strategy (RDS RLS, tenant context propagation)
- Eventing pattern (EventBridge + SQS + DLQ) and schema governance
- NEAR contract upgrade and admin governance (multi-sig + timelock)
- Data retention + archival policy (hot/warm/cold)
