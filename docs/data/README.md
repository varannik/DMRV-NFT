Data management for the platform.

Put here:
- Data models and entity ownership (which service owns which data)
- Data retention, archival, and deletion policies (per region and per tenant)
- Event store strategy (partitioning, retention tiers, replay)
- Data lineage for MRV → verification → hash → registry → NFT lifecycle
