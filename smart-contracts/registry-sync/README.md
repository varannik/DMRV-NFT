# `smart-contracts/registry-sync/`

Optional NEAR contracts for registry synchronization primitives.

Possible uses:
- Global hash registry (on-chain) to prevent cross-registry double counting
- Proof anchoring for registry approvals

If you choose a centralized hash registry instead, document the decision in an ADR.
